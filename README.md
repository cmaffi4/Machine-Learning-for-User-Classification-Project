# Machine-Learning-for-User-Classification-Project

We are embarking on a Machine Learning for User Classification project, focusing on a classification problem where our goal is to predict whether students will upgrade from a free plan to a paid one. In this endeavor, we will leverage a subset of our data, carefully anonymized to exclude personally identifiable information.

The repository contains the Python Jupyter notebook and the csv file. The project has been developed using some of the most common Python libraries, such as Pandas, Numpy, Sklearn, Statsmodels, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

The structure of the project is the following:
  * importing relevant libraries
  * data preprocessing
  * Logistic Regression Model
  * K-Nearest Neighbors Model
  * Support Vector Machines Model
  * Decision Trees Model
  * Random Forests Model
  * Results interpretation

Our analysis will delve into various student engagement metrics, encompassing factors like the number of days students spend on our platform, the minutes of content they watch, and the count of courses they initiate. The objective is to employ these features to train multiple machine learning models, namely logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, support vector machines, decision trees, and random forests.

This predictive analysis holds significant relevance for any business online company, enabling strategic decision-making for targeted advertisements and exclusive offers. By identifying potential customers, we can efficiently allocate our budget towards users likely to convert to the paid plan, ultimately contributing to an increase in overall revenue.
